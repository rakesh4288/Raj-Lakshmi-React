                                <h6>What is DOM ?</h6>
                                <p><b>DOM stands for Document Object Model.</b> In simple terms, it is a structured representation of the HTML elements that are present in a webpage or web app. DOM represents the entire UI of your application. The DOM is represented as a tree data structure. It contains a node for each UI element present in the web document. It is very useful as it allows web developers to modify content through JavaScript, also it being in structured format helps a lot as we can choose specific targets and all the code becomes much easier to work with.</p>

                                <h6>What is Virtual DOM ?</h6>
                                <p><b>VirtualDOM is a lightweighted copy of the actual DOM.</b> Its a virtual representation of the DOM and its optimized the code and take the updates on every object that exists in the original DOM,</p>

                                <p>
                                    Manipulating the DOM is slow,  but manipulating Virtual DOM is very fast because its not taking full refresh of the page, only selected node will get changed.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    So each time there is a change in the state of our application, the virtual DOM gets updated first instead of the real DOM.

When the state of a component changes in an application, the Virtual DOM is getting updated and then compared with its previous state of the component. This feature made things move faster and also reduced cost. <br/> We hope you understood the comparison of virtual dom vs real dom and why React uses virtual dom.

                                React uses a unidirectional data flow, which means that data flows in one direction, from parent to child components. This is a structural best practice for React applications.

                                package.json records the minimum version that your app needs. If you update the versions of a particular package, the change is not going to be reflected here.

                            <p>
                                So lets say I am having some library with ^3.0.0 in package.json and then library team releases version 3.5.2 and now when someone clone my repo and runs npm install in their machine so they will get the version 3.5.2 (You can also put ~ instead of ^ it will update to latest patch version)

                            <p>
                                Actually it is recording the exact version of each installed package in React application which allows you to re-install them. Future installs will be able to build an identical dependency tree.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The package-lock.json is solely used to lock dependencies to a specific version number.

                                Dependencies are mostly required for the production build and core functionality of the React

                                In package.json file, there is an object called as dev Dependencies and it consists of all the packages that are used in the project in its development phase and not in the production or testing environment

                            <p>
                                So, whenever you want to install any library that is required only in your development phase then you can find it in the dev Dependencies object.

                                Derived states is basically a state value that can be computed from the existing states or props instead of storing a independently.

                            <h6>
                                Actually this is a way to avoid the redundant data and keep the states straight forward in the component.
