                            Git is a distributed version control system for tracking the changes in project environment during the software development.  Git is designed for coordinating to work among with all programmers, <br/>Whatever a programmers is working a perticular project in any files that files or piece of code that can be pushed to main repo where other developers can find and update that file also.
                        </p>
